As the story continues in flashback, William discovers two drunk girls - Sarah and the very wasted Katrina - who ask for his assistance. Seeing the helplessness of their situation, William decides to help walk the girls home. William is slowly drawn in by Katrina first by her mindlessly echoing of 'Love me' and then by her demanding a kiss. William gives her a kiss at first reluctantly and then more passionately at her urging. Abigail torments the conflicted William telling him that the girls are really minions of the witches. As the trio approach Katrina's apartment, Sarah can only watch in fear as William becomes more physically possessive of Katrina.",
